## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

**4 Edge Case Tests Failing**:
1. Layer 4: Boundary clamping tolerance
2. Layer 7: Identity transform precision
3. Layer 7: Rotation isometry precision
4. Layer 9: FFT coherence threshold

**Impact**: LOW - core functionality unaffected  
**Fix Time**: 2-4 hours

## 📋 13 Axioms Status

- ✅ **9/13 Fully Verified** (Axioms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)
- ⚠️ **3/13 Partially Verified** (Axioms 4, 5, 6 - work in practice, need explicit tests)
- 📝 **1/13 Theoretical** (Axiom 11 - future enhancement)
