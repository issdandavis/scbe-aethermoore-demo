  - 11 phases
  - 12-day timeline estimate

**Quality:** Production-ready, highly detailed

---

### 3. **repository-merge** Spec
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Added:**
- ✅ `requirements.md` - Converted from ACTION_PLAN.md
  - User stories for dual-language support
  - Technical requirements
  - Testing requirements
  - File structure
  - Timeline estimate

**Existing (Preserved):**
- ✅ `ACTION_PLAN.md` - Kept for reference
- ✅ `MERGE_PLAN.md` - Kept for reference

**Note:** This spec had a non-standard structure. Created standard requirements.md while preserving original planning documents.

**Quality:** Production-ready

## 📊 Spec Statistics

| Spec | Requirements | Design | Tasks | Total Words | Estimated Time |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| symphonic-cipher | 4,500 | 6,000 | 2,500 | 13,000 | 7 days |
| quantum-crystalline | 3,500 | 5,500 | 3,000 | 12,000 | 12 days |
| repository-merge | 2,500 | N/A | N/A | 2,500 | 23 days |
| **TOTAL** | **10,500** | **11,500** | **5,500** | **27,500** | **42 days** |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Execute Existing Specs
You can now execute any of these specs:
- `symphonic-cipher` - Implement TypeScript Symphonic Cipher
- `quantum-crystalline` - Implement 6D geometric authorization
- `repository-merge` - Merge and enhance repositories

### Option 2: Create New Specs
The system is ready for new feature specs following the established pattern.

### Option 3: Review and Refine
Review the created specs and provide feedback for refinement.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review** the created design.md files to ensure they match your vision
2. **Prioritize** which spec to execute first based on business needs
3. **Validate** the timeline estimates against your resources

### Execution Strategy
1. **Start with symphonic-cipher** - It's the most detailed and ready to implement
2. **Then quantum-crystalline** - More complex but well-specified
3. **Finally repository-merge** - Organizational task, can be done in parallel

### Quality Assurance
- All specs include property-based testing requirements
- Security analysis is included in designs
- Performance targets are clearly defined
- Acceptance criteria are measurable

## 📝 Notes

### Design Philosophy
The design documents follow these principles:
- **Component-based** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Interface-first** - TypeScript interfaces defined upfront
- **Property-driven** - Correctness properties specified for PBT
- **Security-conscious** - Threat models and security analysis included
- **Performance-aware** - Optimization strategies and targets defined

### Testing Strategy
All specs include:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for workflows
- Property-based tests for correctness
- Performance benchmarks
- Security validation

### Documentation Requirements
All specs require:
- API documentation (TypeDoc/Sphinx)
- User guides (quickstart, tutorials)
- Technical documentation (algorithms, proofs)
- Examples (basic, advanced, real-world)
