# RWP v2.1 Multi-Signature Envelopes - Requirements

**Feature**: rwp-v2-integration  
**Version**: 3.1.0  
**Phase**: 2 (Protocol Layer)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Timeline**: Q2 2026 (3 months)  
**Dependencies**: Sacred Tongues (✅ Complete)

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Implement the Real World Protocol (RWP) v2.1 for secure AI-to-AI communication using multi-signature envelopes with domain-separated authentication via Sacred Tongues.

### 1.2 Context

This is Phase 2 of the SCBE-AETHERMOORE unified platform. The foundation (v3.0.0) is complete with:
- ✅ Sacred Tongues (6 domains: KO, AV, RU, CA, UM, DR)
- ✅ Post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
- ✅ 14-layer SCBE architecture
- ✅ Hyperbolic geometry security

RWP v2.1 builds on Sacred Tongues to enable secure, policy-enforced communication between AI agents.

### 1.3 Goals

**Primary Goals**:
1. Enable secure AI-to-AI communication with multi-signature consensus
2. Implement policy-based authorization (standard, strict, secret, critical)
3. Prevent replay attacks with timestamp + nonce validation
4. Provide domain-separated authentication via Sacred Tongues
5. Support both TypeScript and Python implementations

**Success Criteria**:
- Agents can send/receive RWP envelopes
- Policy enforcement works correctly
- Replay attacks are prevented
- 95% test coverage
- <10ms envelope creation time
- <5ms envelope verification time

- AC-2.2.6: Policy can be configured per message type

### 2.3 Replay Attack Prevention

**As a** security engineer

- AC-2.3.6: Nonce cache is memory-efficient

### 2.4 Multi-Signature Consensus

**As an** AI orchestrator

- AC-2.4.5: Partial signatures are rejected for critical policy
- AC-2.4.6: Signature order doesn't matter

### 2.5 Key Management

**As a** developer  
**I want to** manage cryptographic keys for each Sacred Tongue  
**So that** I can rotate keys and maintain security

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-2.5.1: Keyring stores keys for all 6 tongues
- AC-2.5.2: Keys can be loaded from secure storage
- AC-2.5.3: Keys can be rotated without breaking existing envelopes
- AC-2.5.4: Key ID (kid) is included in envelope
- AC-2.5.5: Multiple key versions can coexist
- AC-2.5.6: Expired keys are rejected

### 2.6 Interoperability

**As a** platform integrator  
**I want to** use RWP v2.1 from both TypeScript and Python  
**So that** I can integrate with different parts of the system

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- AC-2.6.1: TypeScript SDK creates valid envelopes
