# SCBE-AETHERMOORE Product Overview

## What It Is

SCBE-AETHERMOORE (Spectral Context-Bound Encryption) is a hyperbolic geometry-based security framework implementing a 14-layer architecture. It shifts from traditional possession-based security ("Do you have the key?") to context-based security ("Are you the right entity, in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing, for the right reason?").

## Core Innovation

Security contexts are embedded into Poincaré ball space where the invariant hyperbolic metric provides mathematically provable risk bounds:
```
dℍ(u,v) = arcosh(1 + 2‖u-v‖² / ((1-‖u‖²)(1-‖v‖²)))
```

## Key Features

- 14-Layer Security Architecture (context embedding → audio axis telemetry)
- Hyperbolic Geometry (Poincaré ball model with exponential security boundaries)
- Anti-Fragile Design (system strengthens under attack)
- Harmonic Scaling: H(d,R) = R^(d²) for risk amplification
- Quantum-Resistant (post-quantum cryptographic primitives: ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
- PHDM Intrusion Detection (topological graph theory with 16 canonical polyhedra)

## The 5 Conceptual Layers

1. **Harmonic Foundation** - Musical/geometric harmony as security primitive
2. **Concentric Rings** - Trust zones from Core → Exterior with exponential PoW scaling
3. **Hypercube-Brain Geometry** - Policy (hypercube) intersects behavior (sphere)
4. **Dimensional Fold** - 3D → 17D lift where "wrong math fixes itself"
5. **Temporal** - Time as axis where equations "crystallize on arrival"

## Use Cases

- AI Safety Governance with provable risk bounds
