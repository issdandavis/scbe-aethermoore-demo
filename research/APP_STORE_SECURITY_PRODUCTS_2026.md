# App Store Security Products Research (March 2026)

**Document**: APP-STORE-SECURITY-2026-001
**Author**: Issac Daniel Davis
**Date**: 2026-03-27
**Purpose**: Competitive landscape analysis for SCBE-AETHERMOORE across app stores and marketplaces

---

## Executive Summary

The AI security market is projected to grow from $227-340M (2024-2025) to $4.83B by 2034 (CAGR 35-45%). Only 6% of organizations have advanced AI security strategies. The market is fragmented across five distribution surfaces: mobile app stores, npm/PyPI, HuggingFace, browser extensions, and IDE extensions. SCBE-AETHERMOORE has a unique position as the only product combining geometric (hyperbolic) cost scaling, post-quantum cryptography, and a 14-layer governance pipeline -- but it lacks the packaging, certifications, and UX polish that buyers expect.
