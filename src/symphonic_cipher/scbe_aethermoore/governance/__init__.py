Phase-Breath Hyperbolic Governance

Components:
    - Phase-breath transform (expansion/contraction cycles)
    - Snap protocol (discontinuity detection and rejection)
    - Grand Unified Equation enforcement
    - Causality verification

Governance Principle:
    Actions are not forbidden by policy;
    Invalid actions cannot exist on the manifold
    without violating causality or information balance.
