# SCBE-AETHERMOORE
## One-Page Investment Summary

---

### The Problem
AI agents are proliferating, but there's no standard way to govern what they can access. Traditional security asks "do you have the key?" - not "should you be doing this, right now, in this context?"

### The Solution
**SCBE-AETHERMOORE** - A mathematically-provable security system using hyperbolic geometry and post-quantum cryptography for AI governance.

---

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Code | 31,500+ lines |
| Tests | 96% passing |
| Patents | 6 ready to file |
| Market | $15B+ TAM |

---

### Why Now?
- AI agents need governance (not just authentication)
- Quantum computers threaten current cryptography
- Regulators demanding provable security
- Competitors lack mathematical rigor

---

### Competitive Edge
| Us | Them |
|----|------|
| Math-proven risk bounds | Heuristic scoring |
| Quantum-resistant native | Retrofit planned |
| Context-aware | Key-based only |
| Fail-to-noise | Fail-open/closed |
