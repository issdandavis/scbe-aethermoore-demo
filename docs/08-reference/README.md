# Reference Materials

This section contains archived documentation and reference materials from earlier development phases.

## Archive Contents

The `archive/` folder contains legacy documentation including:

- Original technical specifications
- Development summaries
- Historical test reports
- Earlier versions of guides

These documents are preserved for reference but the primary documentation is now organized in the numbered folders (00-07).

## Using the Archive

If you need to find historical documentation:

```bash
# Search for a specific topic
grep -r "topic" docs/08-reference/archive/

# List all archived files
ls docs/08-reference/archive/
```

## Note

The archived documentation may contain outdated information. Always refer to the current documentation in the numbered folders for the latest guidance.
