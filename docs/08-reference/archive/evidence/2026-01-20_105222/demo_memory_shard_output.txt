--- BONUS: SENSITIVE TOPIC ACCESS ---
Trusted agent 'ash' accessing 'secrets':
  Decision: ALLOW
  Risk: 0.1732

Hostile agent 'hacker' accessing 'secrets':
  Decision: DENY
  Reason: Risk too high: 0.422 >= 0.4
  Risk: 0.4219
  Result: <fail-to-noise> (blocked)

--- THE 60-SECOND STORY ---

We seal AI memories with Sacred Tongue crypto (SpiralSeal SS1).
Where you store it in 6D space determines your risk level.
Harmonic scaling amplifies that risk super-exponentially.
Only if governance approves do you get the memory back.

This demonstrates:
  ✓ SpiralSeal SS1 cipher with spell-text encoding
  ✓ 6D harmonic voxel storage (Fibonacci positions)
  ✓ Governance engine with risk scoring
  ✓ Harmonic scaling for risk amplification
  ✓ Fail-to-noise security (blocked = noise)

The full version includes:
  • Post-quantum cryptography (Kyber768 + Dilithium3)
  • Dual lattice consensus verification
  • Quasicrystal validation
  • Cymatic resonance checking
  • Physics-based acoustic traps

See aws-lambda-simple-web-app/demo_memory_shard.py for the complete implementation.
