## Filing Strategy

### Option 1: File as Continuation-in-Part (CIP)
**Pros**:
- Maintains priority date from original provisional (January 15, 2026)
- Adds new matter (Sacred Tongue integration)
- Can claim both original and new inventions

**Cons**:
- New matter only gets priority from CIP filing date
- More complex prosecution

**Recommendation**: ✅ **File CIP within 12 months** (by January 15, 2027)

### Option 2: File as Separate Application
**Pros**:
- Simpler prosecution
- Independent patent lifecycle
- Can reference original application

**Cons**:
- Loses priority date connection
- May face prior art from original application

**Recommendation**: ❌ Not recommended (loses strategic advantage)

### Option 3: Update Provisional Before Non-Provisional
**Pros**:
- Single unified patent application
- Simplest approach
- All claims get same priority date

**Cons**:
- Must file non-provisional within 12 months of original provisional
- Cannot extend priority date

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ **Only if filing non-provisional soon** (within 3-6 months)
