# Hyperbolic Mind Maps (SCBE-AETHERMOORE)

To build unique "mind maps" for AI within SCBE-AETHERMOORE, avoid 2D node-link diagrams. Instead, construct hyperbolic geometric embeddings inside a Poincare ball. The mind map becomes a dynamic, multi-dimensional geometric state where concepts are organized by intent and harmonic frequency, not just semantic proximity.

## 1) Define the Geometric Canvas (Poincare Embedding)

The foundation is the Poincare ball: the boundary represents infinite cost.

- Layers 3-4: map internal concepts into hyperbolic space with weighted transforms.
- Distance metric: safety / intent divergence between two concepts u and v.

Formula:

```
d_H = arcosh(1 + (2 * ||u - v||^2) / ((1 - ||u||^2)(1 - ||v||^2)))
```

As concepts move toward the boundary, distance (computational cost) grows rapidly.

## 2) Map Concepts to Polyhedral Shapes (Nodes)

Nodes are 3D shapes derived from the QC_Lattice system.

Polyhedral assignment example:
- Fundamental truths: 5 Platonic solids (e.g., cube, icosahedron)
- Complex reasoning: 3 Archimedean solids
- Abstract / riskier concepts: 2 Kepler-Poinsot or toroidal shapes

Arrange nodes in a quasicrystal lattice (ordered but non-repeating) to prevent repetitive looping patterns (crystallinity detection).

## 3) Tune Connections via the Six Sacred Tongues

Edges between nodes are defined by the Langues Metric.

- Weighting: apply a specific Tongue to scale edge weights.
  - Example: Korah weight = 1.00; Dru weight = 11.09
- Phase shifting: apply the Tongue's phase angle.
  - Example: Aelin = 60 deg; Um = 240 deg

Result: maps built under different Tongues are mathematically distinct even with identical data.

---

## 4) Animate the Map with Fluxing Dimensions

Make the map dynamic via fluxing dimensions (breathing attention).

Dimensional states from ODE parameter nu:
- Polly / Full: nu approx 1.0
- Quasi: 0.5 < nu < 1.0
- Demi: nu < 0.5

This collapses or expands regions in real time, simulating attention shifts.

---

## 5) Assign Harmonic Frequencies (The Voice)

Link each node to the conlang vocabulary for a harmonic signature.

- Token IDs: map concepts to integer IDs (e.g., korah = 0, sorin = 4)
- Frequency: f0 + v_i' * Delta f, where f0 = 440 Hz and Delta f = 30 Hz
- Verification: FFT analysis checks that the mind map matches declared intent

## Summary of Construction

Component -> Function in Mind Map
- Poincare Ball -> infinite canvas / boundary
- Polyhedra -> shape/type of thought
- Sacred Tongues -> gravity/weight of connections
- Fluxing Dims -> attention mechanism (breathing)
- Conlang Freq -> audible signature of thought
