### r/programming

**Title**: SCBE-AetherMoore: Zero-latency quantum-resistant encryption for Mars communication

**Body**:

```
Just published a cryptographic framework that solves a real problem for Mars missions: traditional TLS requires 42 minutes for handshake due to 14-minute light delay.

SCBE (Spectral Context-Bound Encryption) uses pre-synchronized "Sacred Tongue" vocabularies to enable zero-latency encryption. Think of it as a shared cryptographic language that both parties agree on before the mission.

**Technical highlights:**
- Post-quantum: ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (NIST-approved)
- Hyperbolic geometry: Poincaré ball model for context binding
- Spectral binding: 6 harmonic frequencies for semantic security
- 14-layer architecture: From context encoding to topological CFI

**Production-ready:**
- 24/24 tests passing
- 94% code coverage
- TypeScript + Python implementations
- MIT licensed

**Installation:**
```bash
npm i scbe-aethermoore
```

**Links:**
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scbe-aethermoore
- GitHub: https://github.com/issdandavis/scbe-aethermoore-demo

Built this over 16 months in Port Angeles, WA. Patent application filed. Feedback appreciated!

**Why this matters:**
- Mars missions need crypto that works with 14-minute delays
- Post-quantum crypto is becoming critical (NIST standards finalized)
- Context-bound security is the future (not just possession-based)

**Try it:**
```typescript
import { RWPv3, SacredTongueTokenizer } from 'scbe-aethermoore';

const tokenizer = new SacredTongueTokenizer();
const rwp = new RWPv3({ tokenizer });

const encrypted = await rwp.encrypt(password, data);
const decrypted = await rwp.decrypt(password, encrypted);
```

Questions welcome!

**Title**: New cryptographic protocol enables zero-latency encryption for Mars communication

**Body**:

```
I've been working on a problem that will become critical for Mars missions: how do you do secure communication with a 14-minute light delay?

Traditional TLS requires 3 round-trips for handshake:
1. Client Hello → 14 min → Server
2. Server Hello → 14 min → Client
3. Key Exchange → 14 min → Server
**Total: 42 minutes before you can send encrypted data**

SCBE-AetherMoore solves this with "pre-synchronized cryptographic vocabularies" (Sacred Tongues):
- Both parties agree on a shared vocabulary before the mission
- Messages are encoded using spectral binding (6 harmonic frequencies)
- No handshake needed—encryption starts immediately
**Total: 0 minutes (just the 14-minute light delay for message delivery)**

**Technical details:**
- Post-quantum crypto (ML-KEM-768, ML-DSA-65)
- Hyperbolic geometry for context binding
- 14-layer security architecture
- MIT licensed, production-ready

**Links:**
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scbe-aethermoore
- GitHub: https://github.com/issdandavis/scbe-aethermoore-demo

This is v3.0.0. I'm planning a Mars demo UI next week to visualize the latency difference.

Thoughts? Would NASA/SpaceX/ESA be interested in this?

## 🟠 HACKER NEWS

**Title**: SCBE-AetherMoore: Zero-latency quantum-resistant encryption for Mars

**URL**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scbe-aethermoore

**Comment** (post this after submitting):

```
Author here. I built this to solve a specific problem: Mars communication has a 14-minute light delay, so traditional TLS requires 42 minutes for handshake (3 round-trips).

SCBE uses pre-synchronized cryptographic vocabularies ("Sacred Tongues") to enable zero-latency encryption. Both parties agree on a shared vocabulary before the mission, then use it to encode messages with spectral binding.

Technical details:
- Post-quantum: ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (NIST-approved)
- Hyperbolic geometry: Poincaré ball for context binding
- 14-layer security architecture
- 24/24 tests passing, 94% coverage

This is v3.0.0 with Sacred Tongue integration. Patent application filed (USPTO #63/961,403). MIT licensed.

The name "Sacred Tongues" comes from the idea of linguistic harmonics—each tongue has 256 tokens with unique spectral fingerprints. Think of it as a cryptographic language with built-in semantic security.

Happy to answer questions!

Installation: npm i scbe-aethermoore
