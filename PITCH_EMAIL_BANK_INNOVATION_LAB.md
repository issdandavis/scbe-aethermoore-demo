## Template 1: Bank Innovation Lab

**Subject:** Physics-based fraud detection - 10x harder to bypass than rules

---

Hi [Name],

I lead R&D at [Your Company]. We've built something unusual: a fraud detection engine based on hyperbolic geometry instead of rules or ML.

**The core idea:** Every transaction maps to a point in curved space. Legitimate behavior clusters near the center. Fraud lives at the edges. The math makes it exponentially harder to fake your position - not linearly harder, exponentially.

**Why this matters for [Bank Name]:**
- Traditional rules: Attackers learn the thresholds, stay just under them
- ML models: Vulnerable to adversarial inputs that fool the classifier
- Our approach: Cost to attack scales as e^(distance²) - there's no "just under the threshold"

**What we're looking for:**
A 60-90 day paid pilot ($25-50k) with your innovation lab or fraud R&D team. We'd run against your sandbox data and compare detection rates vs. your current stack.

**What we've proven:**
- 709 passing tests covering the math
- Sub-50ms latency per transaction
- Post-quantum cryptography built in

Would a 20-minute demo call be useful? I can show the math in action.

Best,

## Template 2: Fintech Fraud Team

**Subject:** We make fraud exponentially expensive (not just harder)

---

Hi [Name],

Quick question: What if attacking your system cost 72 quadrillion times more when someone's behavior is 5x off from normal?

That's not marketing - it's the actual math. We've built a fraud detection engine using hyperbolic geometry where:
- 1x deviation = 2.7x cost to attack
- 5x deviation = 72,000,000,000,000,000x cost

**For [Fintech Name]**, this means:
- Account takeover attempts get flagged before damage
- Synthetic identity fraud detected by behavioral physics
- Bot attacks become economically pointless

We're offering paid pilots to prove the math works on real data. 60-90 days, your sandbox environment, $15-25k.

Interested in a quick demo?

## Template 3: AI Company (Agent Governance)

**Subject:** Mathematical leash for AI agents

---

Hi [Name],

I saw [AI Company] is deploying autonomous agents for [use case]. Quick question: How do you know when an agent goes off-policy?

We've built a governance system where every agent action maps to a point in curved space. Policy-compliant behavior stays near the center. Off-policy drifts toward the edge. The system automatically quarantines anything that strays too far - no human needed.

**The math:**
- Agent position tracked in 6-dimensional hyperbolic space
- Drift toward boundary = exponentially increasing resistance
- System is Lyapunov stable (mathematically proven to self-correct)

We're looking for design partners to pilot this for internal AI governance. Happy to do a technical deep-dive with your ML/safety team.

Worth a call?

## Template 4: Defense Contractor

**Subject:** Post-quantum secure, tamper-evident communications

---

Hi [Name],

We've developed a multi-party authentication protocol that remains secure against quantum computers and provides tamper-evidence at the physics level.

**Key properties:**
- ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 (NIST post-quantum standards)
- 6-way multi-signature with linguistic encoding
- Hyperbolic geometry makes forgery exponentially expensive
- Self-healing under attack (Lyapunov stable)

The system has 709 passing tests and is designed for high-stakes environments where "probably secure" isn't good enough.

Would [Defense Company]'s secure communications team be interested in a technical review?

## Follow-up Email (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject]

---

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about physics-based fraud detection.

If it helps, here's a 3-minute video showing the math in action: [Link]

The key insight: Traditional security is binary (in/out). Ours is continuous and exponential. Small deviations = small cost. Large deviations = impossible cost.

Happy to jump on a quick call this week if useful.

## LinkedIn Connection Request

Interested in connecting - I'm working on physics-based security (hyperbolic geometry for fraud detection). Always happy to chat about novel approaches to an old problem.

## Tips for Outreach

1. **Subject line:** Specific, curiosity-provoking, no clickbait
2. **First sentence:** Get to the point - what you do, why it's different
3. **Middle:** Why THEY should care (their pain point)
4. **Ask:** Specific, low-commitment (20-min call, not "buy our product")
5. **Follow-up:** Day 5, add value (video, article, insight)
6. **Don't:** Attach files, use "just checking in", be vague

**Response rate benchmark:** 5-10% for cold email. 20%+ for warm intros.
