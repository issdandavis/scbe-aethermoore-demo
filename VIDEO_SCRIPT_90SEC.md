# SCBE-AETHERMOORE 90-Second Demo Video Script

## Setup
- Screen recording software (Loom, OBS, or phone)
- Terminal open in project directory
- Browser ready for Swagger UI

---

## Script (90 seconds)

### Opening (0-15 sec)
**[Show GitHub repo page]**

"This is SCBE-AETHERMOORE - a quantum-resistant security engine using hyperbolic geometry. 

Notice the green CI badge - over 1,100 tests passing. Let me show you what it does."

---

### Demo Part 1: Run the Demo (15-45 sec)
**[Switch to terminal]**

"One command to see it in action:"

```bash
python demo.py
```

**[Wait for output, point to key lines]**

"Watch this - a trusted medical AI agent gets QUARANTINE status with a low risk score.

But when a hacker tries to access from outside the trust boundary... DENY. 

And here's the key innovation - instead of an error message, the attacker gets random noise. They can't even tell they were blocked."

---

### Demo Part 2: The Math (45-70 sec)
**[Point to the numbers in output]**

"The magic is hyperbolic geometry. See this distance of 3.9? In hyperbolic space, that's exponentially far from the origin.

The harmonic scaling amplifies that to 10^15 - making unauthorized access mathematically impossible, not just difficult."

---

### Closing (70-90 sec)
**[Show Swagger UI or README]**

"This is the core engine. We have a REST API ready for integration.

We're running 3-month pilots with banks and AI startups for $15K.

If you're building AI agents that handle sensitive data, let's talk.

Link in description. Thanks for watching."

## Key Points to Hit
1. ✅ Green CI badge = credibility
2. ✅ Trusted agent → QUARANTINE (allowed)
3. 🚫 Hacker → DENY + fail-to-noise
4. 📐 Hyperbolic geometry = exponential security
5. 💰 Pilot program available

## Recording Tips
- Keep energy up but professional
- Pause briefly on key output lines
- Don't rush the math explanation
- End with clear call-to-action
