# SCBE Production Pack

SCBE (Spectral Context-Bound Encryption) is a unified security framework combining:

1. **Mathematical Core (Python)**: 14-layer hyperbolic geometry pipeline with axioms A1-A12
2. **Cryptographic Envelope (TypeScript)**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption for AI model interactions

## Core Capabilities

- **Hyperbolic Risk Governance**: Poincaré ball embeddings with provable boundedness (A1-A12)
- **Cryptographic Protection**: AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption with 96-bit nonces
- **Replay Prevention**: Bloom filter + nonce management prevents message replay attacks
- **Tamper Detection**: Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) ensures message integrity
- **Coherence Signals**: Spectral, spin, audio, and trust metrics bounded in [0,1]
- **Risk-Gated Decisions**: ALLOW/QUARANTINE/DENY based on amplified risk functional

## Mathematical Contract

All proofs hinge on:
- Hyperbolic state stays inside compact sub-ball 𝔹ⁿ_{1-ε}
- All ratio features use denominator floor ε > 0
- All channels bounded and enter risk monotonically with nonnegative weights

## Security Model

The system implements a "fail-to-noise" policy where cryptographic failures produce opaque error messages. Risk decisions gate envelope creation - DENY blocks, QUARANTINE flags for audit.

## Operational Focus

Production infrastructure with comprehensive metrics, alerting thresholds, and axiom compliance verification. Changes must satisfy A1-A12 constraints.
