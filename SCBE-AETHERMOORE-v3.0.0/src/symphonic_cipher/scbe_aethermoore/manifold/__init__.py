"""
9D Quantum Hyperbolic Manifold Memory

Dimensions:
    1-3: Spatial (x, y, z) in Poincaré ball
    4:   Time (triadic dilation)
    5:   Intent vector magnitude
    6:   Entropy flow
    7:   Quantum state phase
    8:   Breath cycle (expansion/contraction)
    9:   Coherence field

Key Operations:
    - Geodesic computation in curved space
    - Boundary detection (||u|| → 1)
    - Snap detection (discontinuity exceeds tensile strength)
