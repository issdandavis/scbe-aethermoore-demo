"""Test boundary exploitation attacks against the Poincare ball model.

Boundary attacks push representations toward the edge of the Poincare disk
where:
  1. Distances become exponentially large (cost explosion)
  2. The harmonic wall H(d,R) = R^(d^2) provides exponential resistance
  3. Numerical precision issues can create edge-case behavior

These tests verify that the boundary detection signal catches
attempts to push state toward the disk edge.
